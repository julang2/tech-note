# spring事务管理 - Transaction Management

## 配置PlatformTransactionManager

org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager

```java
public interface PlatformTransactionManager {

	/**
	 * Return a currently active transaction or create a new one, according to
	 * the specified propagation behavior.
	 * <p>Note that parameters like isolation level or timeout will only be applied
	 * to new transactions, and thus be ignored when participating in active ones.
	 * <p>Furthermore, not all transaction definition settings will be supported
	 * by every transaction manager: A proper transaction manager implementation
	 * should throw an exception when unsupported settings are encountered.
	 * <p>An exception to the above rule is the read-only flag, which should be
	 * ignored if no explicit read-only mode is supported. Essentially, the
	 * read-only flag is just a hint for potential optimization.
	 * @param definition the TransactionDefinition instance (can be {@code null} for defaults),
	 * describing propagation behavior, isolation level, timeout etc.
	 * @return transaction status object representing the new or current transaction
	 * @throws TransactionException in case of lookup, creation, or system errors
	 * @throws IllegalTransactionStateException if the given transaction definition
	 * cannot be executed (for example, if a currently active transaction is in
	 * conflict with the specified propagation behavior)
	 * @see TransactionDefinition#getPropagationBehavior
	 * @see TransactionDefinition#getIsolationLevel
	 * @see TransactionDefinition#getTimeout
	 * @see TransactionDefinition#isReadOnly
	 */
	TransactionStatus getTransaction(@Nullable TransactionDefinition definition) throws TransactionException;

	/**
	 * Commit the given transaction, with regard to its status. If the transaction
	 * has been marked rollback-only programmatically, perform a rollback.
	 * <p>If the transaction wasn't a new one, omit the commit for proper
	 * participation in the surrounding transaction. If a previous transaction
	 * has been suspended to be able to create a new one, resume the previous
	 * transaction after committing the new one.
	 * <p>Note that when the commit call completes, no matter if normally or
	 * throwing an exception, the transaction must be fully completed and
	 * cleaned up. No rollback call should be expected in such a case.
	 * <p>If this method throws an exception other than a TransactionException,
	 * then some before-commit error caused the commit attempt to fail. For
	 * example, an O/R Mapping tool might have tried to flush changes to the
	 * database right before commit, with the resulting DataAccessException
	 * causing the transaction to fail. The original exception will be
	 * propagated to the caller of this commit method in such a case.
	 * @param status object returned by the {@code getTransaction} method
	 * @throws UnexpectedRollbackException in case of an unexpected rollback
	 * that the transaction coordinator initiated
	 * @throws HeuristicCompletionException in case of a transaction failure
	 * caused by a heuristic decision on the side of the transaction coordinator
	 * @throws TransactionSystemException in case of commit or system errors
	 * (typically caused by fundamental resource failures)
	 * @throws IllegalTransactionStateException if the given transaction
	 * is already completed (that is, committed or rolled back)
	 * @see TransactionStatus#setRollbackOnly
	 */
	void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;

	/**
	 * Perform a rollback of the given transaction.
	 * <p>If the transaction wasn't a new one, just set it rollback-only for proper
	 * participation in the surrounding transaction. If a previous transaction
	 * has been suspended to be able to create a new one, resume the previous
	 * transaction after rolling back the new one.
	 * <p><b>Do not call rollback on a transaction if commit threw an exception.</b>
	 * The transaction will already have been completed and cleaned up when commit
	 * returns, even in case of a commit exception. Consequently, a rollback call
	 * after commit failure will lead to an IllegalTransactionStateException.
	 * @param status object returned by the {@code getTransaction} method
	 * @throws TransactionSystemException in case of rollback or system errors
	 * (typically caused by fundamental resource failures)
	 * @throws IllegalTransactionStateException if the given transaction
	 * is already completed (that is, committed or rolled back)
	 */
	void rollback(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;

### JDBC配置PlatformTransactionManager

定义JDBC DataSource

```xml
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}" />
    <property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}" />
    <property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}" />
    <property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}" />
</bean>
```

定义PlatformTransactionManager的实现DataSourceTransactionManager

```xml
<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>
```

### Hibernate配置PlatformTransactionManager

```xml
<bean id="sessionFactory" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate5.LocalSessionFactoryBean">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
    <property name="mappingResources">
        <list>
            <value>org/springframework/samples/petclinic/hibernate/petclinic.hbm.xml</value>
        </list>
    </property>
    <property name="hibernateProperties">
        <value>
            hibernate.dialect=${hibernate.dialect}
        </value>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate5.HibernateTransactionManager">
    <property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory"/>
</bean>
```

## 声明性事务 - Declarative transaction management

### Using @Transactional

```xml
<!-- from the file 'context.xml' -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
    xmlns:tx="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">
    <!-- this is the service object that we want to make transactional -->
    <bean id="fooService" class="x.y.service.DefaultFooService"/>

    <!-- enable the configuration of transactional behavior based on annotations -->
    <tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="txManager"/><!-- a PlatformTransactionManager is still
    required -->

    <bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
        <!-- (this dependency is defined somewhere else) -->
        <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
    </bean>
    <!-- other <bean/> definitions here -->
</beans>
```

Tip
> You can omit the transaction-manager attribute in the <tx:annotation-driven/> tag if the bean name of the PlatformTransactionManager that you want to wire in has the name transactionManager. If the PlatformTransactionManager bean that you want to dependency-inject has any other name, then you have to use the transaction-manager attribute explicitly, as in the preceding example.

Note
> The `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation provides equivalent support if you are using Java based configuration. Simply add the annotation to a @Configuration class. See the javadocs for full details.

> Method visibility and @Transactional When using proxies, you should apply the @Transactional annotation only to methods with public visibility. If you do annotate protected, private or package-visible methods with the @Transactional annotation, no error is raised, but the annotated method does not exhibit the configured transactional settings. Consider the use of AspectJ (see below) if you need to annotate non-public methods.

```java
// the service class that we want to make transactional
@Transactional
public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {
    Foo getFoo(String fooName);
    Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);
    void insertFoo(Foo foo);
    void updateFoo(Foo foo);
}
```

Tip
> Spring recommends that you only annotate concrete classes (and methods of concrete classes) with the @Transactional annotation, as opposed to annotating interfaces. You certainly can place the @Transactional annotation on an interface (or an interface method), but this works only as you would expect it to if you are using interface-based proxies. The fact that Java annotations are not inherited from interfaces means that if you are using class-based proxies ( proxy-target-class="true") or the weaving-based aspect ( mode="aspectj"), then the transaction settings are not recognized by the proxying and weaving infrastructure, and the object will not be wrapped in a transactional proxy, which would be decidedly bad.

Note
> In proxy mode (which is the default), only external method calls coming in through the proxy are intercepted. This means that self-invocation, in effect, a method within the target object calling another method of the target object, will not lead to an actual transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with @Transactional. Also, the proxy must be fully initialized to provide the expected behaviour so you should not rely on this feature in your initialization code, i.e. @PostConstruct.
